# Synopsis
A simple single page application that uses the Foursquare API to allow the user to search for popular/recommended venues by area.

# Summary
I decided to take a MVC approach because separating the model, view and controller will make it very easy for other developers to contribute and build on the application. Everything is on one page for installation ease, however if this was part of a larger project it would be beneficial to move the controller, filter and css to appropriate external files. I included the Bootstrap framework for quick, responsive styling, and I also added the Font Awesome framework so that I didn't have to add a loading image to the repository keeping things as simple and lightweight as possible.

# Installation
Simply place index.html on your local server and navigate to the page in a web browser, e.g. http://localhost/index.html
